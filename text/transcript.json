            "Discussion about a chatbot being developed that does not auto-flag HR issues but should ideally identify HR issues in transcripts.",
            "The chatbot is expected to split audio files correctly and summarize conversations from audio files.",
            "Concerns about Smolder's character design in a game, specifically the balance of having a true damage burn which might not be balanced.",
            "Kevin and others discussed the balance of the game and the impact of making characters like Smolder appealing to a younger, more diverse audience.",
            "There's an upcoming buff to Smolder that makes it easier to stack, but Kevin is not familiar with the details.",
            "Discussion on how easy-to-play champions affect the pro scene and the skill ceiling of the game.",
            "It's suggested that champions that are easy to learn but hard to master are beneficial for attracting new players while retaining a high skill ceiling.",
            "Smolder is considered easy to pick up with a reasonably high skill ceiling, fitting into the category of being easy to learn and hard to master."
